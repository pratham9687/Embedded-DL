# Embedded-DL
This project aims to create Neural networks and upload them to Arduino's flash memory. Neural networks can be created, trained and stored in txt file, c/c++ header file and Arduino compatible header files using a python module Deep_learning.py that doesn't use any prebuilt framework to create or train neural networks. The basic idea is to create and train neural networks on the computer via simulation or datasets then deploy the trained neural network to Arduino's flash memory. This folder repository also includes an example where an Arduino is used for house price prediction where the inputs and outputs are provided over serial port.
